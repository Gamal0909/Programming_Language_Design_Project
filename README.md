# Programming Language Design Project

## Description
This project involves the design and implementation of a custom programming language. It includes the creation of a parser, interpreter, and compiler for the language, along with syntax and semantic analysis tools. The goal is to explore programming language theory and create a working prototype of a language with unique features.

## Features
- Custom syntax and grammar
- Parser and interpreter for language execution
- Compiler to convert code into executable instructions

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gamal0909/Programming_Language_Design_Project.git
